College project where I simulated winner and placement of each Country during EURO 2020 in football/soccer in R programming language.

First I simulated how groups will end if each country had the same chance of winning the group and then I gave each of countries real probability of winning the group and advancing to knockout stage.

Results can be seen on images within "Simulation winners_example images" folder.

This a simple simulation which can be adjusted, used and played with for any type of similar competition.

Hope it helps someone :)
